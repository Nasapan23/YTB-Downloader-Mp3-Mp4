  This is a simple Python application that allows you to download videos and audio from YouTube in either MP4 or MP3 format. The application uses the pytube library to interact with the YouTube API and download the requested content. The visual interface is built using the tkinter library, which provides a simple and intuitive way to create desktop applications in Python.
  I created this project because I was frustrated with the poor performance and reliability of many of the existing YouTube downloader websites. With this application, I can quickly and easily download the content I need without having to worry about slow loading times, intrusive ads, or malware.

Technologies Used:
-Python
-pytube library
-tkinter library
